So far, very disappointing. The shears only cut near the bottom 1/3 of the blades and barely cuts anything that goes beyond that point. Not worth the price. Luckily, I found my original shears that cuts anything you desire after years of use. The Shun shears will adorn my kitchen drawer but that is about all it is good for.</span>\n<div class=\"bvseo-pubdate\">Date published: 2015-03-16</div>\n<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2015-03-16\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"bvseo-review\" itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\" data-reviewid=\"71091847\">\n<meta itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" content=\"Shun Kitchen Shears\" />\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\nRated <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">5</span> out of\n<span itemprop=\"bestRating\">5</span>\n</span> by\n<span itemprop=\"author\">deez</span> from\n<span itemprop=\"name\">MUST HAVE ACCESSORY</span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\">Probably one of the most overused and underappreciated tools in the kitchen. This kitchen shears are like computers and cellphones (for most of us), once you use them, you ask yourself &lsquo;what took me so long to get one.&rsquo;\nIf you spend as much time in the kitchen as I do you&rsquo;ll learn to appreciate having a good pair of kitchen shears on you and this is a GREAT kitchen shears. These are a little on the &lsquo;large&rsquo; size but I have paws for hands so it works well for me. This also comes with a clip on holder that allows you to store it conveniently close by for easy access.\nI can go on about the shears but all I can tell you is if you are only going to buy one pair of shears, get one that is well made and will last you a lifetime.</span>\n<div class=\"bvseo-pubdate\">Date published: 2015-01-29</div>\n<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2015-01-29\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"bvseo-review\" itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\" data-reviewid=\"47044681\">\n<meta itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" content=\"Shun Kitchen Shears\" />\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\nRated <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">5</span> out of\n<span itemprop=\"bestRating\">5</span>\n</span> by\n<span itemprop=\"author\">Lupo</span> from\n<span itemprop=\"name\">Best I've owned</span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\">Sharp with a precise snipping action, these are wonderful shears. They are heavy enough to use as poultry shears but one feels loath to use such lovely tools for heavy tasks. They can take it, believe me. Very easily separated and a breeze to clean.</span>\n<div class=\"bvseo-pubdate\">Date published: 2013-10-07</div>\n<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2013-10-07\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"bvseo-review\" itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\" data-reviewid=\"44538886\">\n<meta itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" content=\"Shun Kitchen Shears\" />\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\nRated <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">5</span> out of\n<span itemprop=\"bestRating\">5</span>\n</span> by\n<span itemprop=\"author\">TrapperJoe</span> from\n<span itemprop=\"name\">Must Have Kitchen Accessory</span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\">I purchased the Shun Kitchen Shears to go with my growing Shun Knife collection. The first time I used them was when I was cutting up a chicken for the grill. The ease in which I removed the backbone was worth the cost of the shears! When I washed the shears I was pleasantly surprised when they separated into two parts for ease of cleaning.Very clever.</span>\n<div class=\"bvseo-pubdate\">Date published: 2013-08-04</div>\n<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2013-08-04\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"bvseo-review\" itemprop=\"review\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\" data-reviewid=\"34180519\">\n<meta itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" content=\"Shun Kitchen Shears\" />\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\nRated <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">5</span> out of\n<span itemprop=\"bestRating\">5</span>\n</span> by\n<span itemprop=\"author\">DrSuess</span> from\n<span itemprop=\"name\">Wonderful tool for an arthritic hand</span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\">These shears are great, not only because they are long and sharp, but for the special large opening that the four fingers of my hand fit and I can use them with no pain!
